# HexRenamer
This is a tiny thing I wrote to rename generative NFT art file with 64 character hexadecimal file names
necessary for ERC1155 contracts. It's super simple. As written it looks for files in the folder "export"
and spits out to a folder called "hexed". This is something that a developer would never think to explain,
but for us non-devs it's a royal pain in the ass to figure out. This comes up in some of the Moralis tutorials.
